# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator

**Overview**\

The Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a command-line-based calculator that supports large integer arithmetic beyond standard data type limits. It is implemented using Doubly Linked List data structures to efficiently handle operations on numbers of arbitrary size.

This project resembles the bc command, a terminal-based calculator that provides precise results for even larger operand values

**Operations**\

Arthemetic  operations for large numbers(positive numbers)..
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

**Commands passed through Command Line Arguments**\

   ```bash
   ./a.out operand-1 operator operand-2
   ```

   **Example**:
  
   ```
   ./a.out 987654323456786543234567 + 765433456787654334567876543345
   ```
   
   ```bash
   Result : 765434444441977791354419777912
